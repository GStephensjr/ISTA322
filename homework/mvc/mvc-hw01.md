##### 11. Chapter 1 does not discuss the MVC pattern specically, and in a sense this entire course is an extended examination of the MVC pattern. Using an independent resource (such as Wikipedia) briefly state the responsibility of (a) the model, (b) the controller, and (c) the view.
- The Model: data/object, the thing being moved around and manipulated
- The Controller: the application logic or brain of the process
- The View: the user interface, or the visual representation of the model
