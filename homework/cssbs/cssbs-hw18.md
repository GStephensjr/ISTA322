___
##### 1. You are building a help ticket system. You want to ensure that the older the ticket, the sooner it will be handled by the team. For example, a ticket submitted a week ago has a higher priority than a ticked just submitted. What kind of data structure would you use, and why?
Queue<T>
- queue uses a First In First Out method that will allow your oldest tickets to be addressed first

##### 2. You are building a tracking system for seasonal agricultural farm labor. The labor requirements vary widely, depending on the season. Your requirement is that the newest hires are terminated first, and that our more experienced hires are kept longer. What kind of data structure would you use, and why?
Stack<T>
- a stack will allow for a Last In First Out methodology that ensures the newest hires will be at the top of the collection to be examined or removed

##### 3. You are building a transaction database. Your requirement is that the database adds data very quickly, and that deletions, updates, and searches happen infrequently. In other words, data is typically added in the order in which the transaction occurs. What kind of data structure would you use, and why?
List<T>
- new items are added at the end, its easy and fast to add data. its difficult to search however, it isnt sorted
##### 4. You are building an analytical database. Your requirement is that the database handle queries very quickly, but that the data never changes, i.e., there are no inserts, deletions, or updates. What kind of data structure would you use, and why?
SortedList<TKey, TValue>
- Sorted lists are much faster than dictionaries to retrieve data.

##### 5. You are building a personnel directory, where searches are performed by last name, first name, middle name. What kind of data structure would you use, and why?
SortedList<TKey, TValue>
- Sorted lists are much faster than dictionaries to retrieve data.
Dictionary<TKey, TValue>

##### 6. You are building a username/password database. Your requirement is that updates happen frequently (when users change their passwords) and that searches (to authenticate users) happen extremely quickly. What kind of data structure would you use, and why?
Dictionary<TKey, TValue>

##### 7. What is a lambda expression? Give an example. Why would we use a lambda expression?
a lambda expression is a function that isnt declared by an identifier. you would use it when you didnt want to name your expression, or if you wanted to just use it once and get rid of it

##### 8. What is the difference between lambda expressions and anonymous methods? What are the advantages of each?
a lambda expression is essentially a different way of defining an anonymous method, it is smoother and doesnt require the delegate keyword
